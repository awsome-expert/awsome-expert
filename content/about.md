## About Me

Hello there, I'm **Jarl TÃ¶rnroos**, a **DevOps specialist** with a passion for building high-performance, scalable, and resilient applications in the cloud. I strongly believe that development teams should be kept small with end-to-end responsibility for their product/service.

My expertise includes architecting and managing high-availability solutions for high-traffic applications in the cloud, and I have led teams for projects with billions of monthly impressions. I am constantly studying and learning new technologies in the industry to stay ahead of the curve, and I have been working with **Amazon Web Services (AWS) for over ten years**.

In my work, I follow the **AWS Well-Architected framework** to ensure that my projects are designed with security, reliability, performance, cost optimization, and operational excellence in mind. This approach helps me to deliver robust and scalable solutions that meet the needs of my clients.
