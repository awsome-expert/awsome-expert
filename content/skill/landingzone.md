# Landing Zone

A landing zone is a well-architected, multi-account AWS environment that is a starting point from which you can deploy workloads and applications.

Organizations is a powerful AWS feature that provides a landing zone setup for managing multiple AWS accounts within an organization. As an experienced AWS architect, I can help you set up a robust Organizations configuration that includes consolidated billing and Service Control Policies (SCPs).

SCPs are an essential component of a secure and well-managed AWS environment. They allow you to restrict access to specific AWS services, even for users with administrative access. This is important for maintaining compliance with regulatory requirements and ensuring that only authorized users have access to sensitive data or services.

In configuring your Organizations setup, I can help you define and enforce SCPs that align with your organization's security and compliance needs. I can also assist with establishing best practices for managing AWS accounts, setting up consolidated billing, and creating a centralized logging and monitoring solution.

Once an Organization has been established, creating new AWS member accounts can be done easily and efficiently using Infrastructure as Code (IaC).
