# Kubernetes

Kubernetes is an extremely popular container orchestration tool known for its highly modular ecosystem, and its **popularity continues to grow**. With several **years of experience** working with **EKS**, **kOps**, and **OpenShift**, I have witnessed firsthand the benefits of using Kubernetes for container management.

Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (**EKS**) offers **excellent integration** with other **AWS services**. For example, EKS can run fully **serverless** with the help of **Fargate** for the Pods. **Secret Manager** and **SSM Parameter Store** can be synchronized with **Kubernetes secrets**, and **IAM roles** can be directly integrated with **Kubernetes Service**, while **security groups** can be integrated with **deployments/Pods**. This seamless integration allows EKS to leverage the security services provided by AWS, providing a secure and reliable platform for container deployment.

In addition to Kubernetes, I have also worked with other container orchestration tools such as **ECS** and **Docker Swarm**.
