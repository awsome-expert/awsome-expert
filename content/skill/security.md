# Security

AWS offers a range of services that can help protect your data, accounts, and workloads from unauthorized access. However, many overlook the importance of investing time in security, which can result in a lack of attention to this critical area.

With my knowledge and expertise in securing environments, I can provide valuable assistance in the following areas:

* Configuring IAM properly for both machines and users to ensure proper access control.
* Protecting AWS accounts with Service Control Policies (SCP), AWS CloudTrail, and AWS Config to monitor and prevent unauthorized activity.
* Securing the network with public, private, and internal subnets and implementing proper security groups to control access. VPC flow logs can be used to log network traffic.
* Implementing encryption in transit, at rest, and end-to-end encryption to ensure data privacy and security.
* Monitoring the environment using services such as GuardDuty and Security Hub, and setting up security alarms to detect security breaches, such as those outlined in the [CIS Benchmarks](https://aws.amazon.com/what-is/cis-benchmarks/).
* Implementing secure solutions for site-to-site VPN and Client VPN.

In addition to providing these security measures, I can also help you avoid common anti-patterns such as using IAM users for Kubernetes pods or other machines.
