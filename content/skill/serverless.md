# Serverless

In a serverless architecture, the cloud provider manages the infrastructure and automatically allocates computing resources as needed to execute and scale applications. As a result, developers can focus on building their applications without worrying about underlying hardware or infrastructure.

One of the main benefits of serverless computing is cost efficiency. For example, with Lambda functions, you only pay for the milliseconds the software is running, compared to traditional Virtual Machines (VM) that charge for the hours they are running, even if they are idle for most of the day. This cost efficiency makes it possible to get started with serverless architecture for almost nothing, and it also reduces "soft costs" since there is no need for additional operations work, as everything is outsourced to the cloud provider.

Another benefit of serverless computing is scalability. The cloud provider automatically scales computing resources up or down based on application demand, allowing applications to handle fluctuations in traffic without infrastructure constraints. This scalability also provides improved application performance and more efficient use of resources.

As someone who has experience working with fully serverless architecture, I can help with architectural challenges and implementation.
