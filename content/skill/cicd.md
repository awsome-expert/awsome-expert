# CI/CD

I have extensive experience working with continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) processes. I am proficient in a variety of tools and technologies related to CI/CD, including **CloudPipeline/CloudBuild**, **GitLb CI**, and **Jenkins**.

I've previousle been responsible for implementing CI/CD pipelines supporting **feature environments**. A feature environment is an automatically created **dynamic environment** for every feature developed, that is **isolated** from any other environemnt. This can easily be implemented for **Kubernetes** but is not limited. I've workted with complex pipelines for both **mono repositories** as well as for **multi repository** strategy.
